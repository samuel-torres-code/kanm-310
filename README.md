KANM Dashboard coded in XAMPP stack (Apache, PHP, HTML/CSS) 

# How to Run

XAMPP is really weird.

It basically serves whatever you have in the htdocs/ folder on the localhost.

To make this webpage render on `localhost/kanm-310` you need to clone this repo in the XAMPP application files.

This is found in `Applications/XAMPP/htdocs` on Mac.
